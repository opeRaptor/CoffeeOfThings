Connected Coffee Pot

First prototype of the transmitter:
- 3 LDRs sense light level at 3 points 
- TMP36 sense temperature 
Note: The temperature is probably offset ~+5C

The program guess the level of coffee using the light sensors for low and mid level, and use the temperature to sense if full or empty.
